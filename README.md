The goal of this data analysis is to find any patterns or relations between school budget, school size, and school type (charter,distrct).  School budget is broken down into a per capita basis essentially putting a price of education per head of student.  School sizes vary from quite small Holden High School (427) to exceptionally large Bailey High School (4976). There are two types of schools in the distrct that pressumably recieve funding from public tax dollars (distrct) and private funding (charter).   Averages of Math and Reading scores along with percentages of students with passing grades of either, and an overall passing score percentage of both, are displayed in various dataframes that check against the afformentioned variables.  After analyzing the data set, there are two abundanlty distinctions that can be made.

Firstly, school budget and size do not appear to directly influence student perfomance.  Wilson High and Ford High have approximatly the same Student Budget (1.3mll and 1.7mill) and size (2283 and 2739) but have drastically different overall passing rates ( 90.5% and 54.3%).  This leads to the second and more glaringly obvious conclusion.  Every charter school no matter the size or budget per student head does not fall below 89% overall passing rate. Conversely, no district school has an overall pass rate above 55%.

Final Conlusion:  With the provided data, Charter Schools perform better than District Schools.
